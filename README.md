AsTS是一款教师出卷辅助软件，全称Assistant in Test Setting。它的主要功能在于：当英语教师从网上获取一篇英文文章后，它可以将文章中的超纲词汇替换为考纲内词汇，以便于让试卷处于一个适当的难度。当然，它也可以作为一个辅助学生阅读课外英文读物的，但是我们建议学生在教师的协助下使用该软件。

AsTS is an assistant software for teachers to set testing papers, whose fullname is Assistant in Test Setting.Its main function is that when an English teacher obtains an English article from the Internet, it can replace the super-syllabus vocabulary in the article with the vocabulary in the syllabus, so as to make the test paper in an appropriate difficulty. Of course, it can also be used as an assistant for students to read extra-curricular English books, but we recommend that students use the software with the help of teachers.
